        {"from":"gpt","value":"Another recent study has explored the use of graphene-based devices for active modulation of THz SPPs in a metasurface configuration (Kuznetsov et al., 2020). In this work, the researchers used a metasurface consisting of an array of gold nanorods on a silicon substrate, with a graphene layer on top. By applying a gate voltage to the graphene layer, they were able to modulate the THz transmission through the metasurface by up to 25%. The authors attribute this effect to the coupling between the THz SPPs on the gold nanorods and the graphene plasmons, and they suggest that this approach could be useful for THz sensing and imaging applications.\n\nIn addition to these experimental studies, there have also been several theoretical investigations into the active control of THz SPPs using graphene-based structures. For example, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have used numerical simulations to show that graphene can be used to modulate the intensity and phase of THz radiation (Chen and Alù, 2012). They propose a graphene-based metasurface consisting of an array of graphene ribbons on a dielectric substrate, which can be used to control the amplitude and phase of THz SPPs with high efficiency. Another theoretical study by researchers at the University of Sydney has investigated the use of graphene-based plasmonic waveguides for the active control of THz SPPs (Liu et al., 2017). They show that by applying a gate voltage to a graphene layer, the dispersion and propagation length of THz SPPs can be actively controlled, providing a means of manipulating THz radiation at the nanoscale.\n\nThese studies highlight the potential of graphene-based structures for the active control of THz SPPs, and suggest that such structures could find a range of applications in areas such as sensing, imaging, and communication. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed in terms of developing efficient and practical devices that can exploit the unique properties of graphene and THz SPPs.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Kuznetsov, S.
